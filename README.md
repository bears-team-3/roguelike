# The Labyrinth
Simple Roguelike game where you play as an unknown hero tasked to enter the Labyrinth and slay the Minotaur. 

The game has 7 depths, each progressively harder than the last. 

The hero has to ration their food wisely or will likely end up starving before finding their target.

As they slay more enemies, they gain strength, necessary for the defeat of the minotaur.

Those who fall will be forgotten, but those who manage the impossible will have their names remembered forever. (Leaderboard not yet implemented)

Good luck Hero!
